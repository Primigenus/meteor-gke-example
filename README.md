Meteor Container Engine example app
=====

This is a simple example Meteor app used with @q42/meteor-on-gke to demonstrate
Meteor running on Kubernetes on Container Engine.

It does two things: print the public IP address of the machine the app is
running on, and offer some simple interaction with the MongoDB database to show
there is persistent data irrespective of the machine.
